# Simplified Auto-Fetching Microservice SDK

This SDK is designed for automatic data fetching and integration between microservices. Its main features are:

1. **Automatic Fetching**: automatically retrieves and integrates related objects from different microservices.

2. **JWT Authentication**: Uses JWT tokens for secure communication between microservices.

3. **Flexible Configuration**: Allows you to easily configure microservices endpoints.

4. **Attribute-Based**: Uses C# attributes to specify automatic fetching, making it easier to use.

5. **Asynchronous Operations**: Supports asynchronous operations for efficient performance.

6. **Scalable**: Can be used for different types of objects and microservices.

This SDK is ideal for simplifying data integration in microservice architectures, reducing code duplication and improving application performance.
